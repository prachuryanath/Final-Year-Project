## Abstract
An underwater robot that can navigate by itself is called an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). AUVs are employed in lake, ocean, and ocean floor research. AUVs can be equipped with a variety of sensors to measure the concentration of different elements or compounds. For the industry today, underwater exploration and inspection present a significant challenge. Our access to the underwater environment could be completely changed by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). AUVs could help with pressing issues like shallow water mine countermeasures, climate change assessment, underwater search and mapping, and habitat monitoring.

Underwater imagery is a powerful tool for hydrographic inspection, including the bathymetry and aquatic possibilities over the extent of the swath. For underwater autonomous operation, intelligent computer vision is the most important technology. Underwater detection mainly depends on  digital cameras, and image processing is commonly used to enhance the quality and reduce the noise.
